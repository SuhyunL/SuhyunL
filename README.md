#### Examples

If you put a keyword '80s',
- 1990s: The most relatable word with the keyword
- Music / Rock / Aesthetic : People seemed to think of the 80s as an artistic, memorable, and musical.
- Nostalgia, Recall, Longing : People consider 80s as the time full of aesthetics and music, so it's natural to miss it!

If you put a keyword 'SportyandRich', (FYI- SportyandRich is a brand where the concept is "we sell clothes that Princess Diana might wear after her tennis stroll")
- Fashion: One of the trend-leading brands, so of course!
- Aesthetic: To explain Pinteresty - fashion - style, people use the word 'Aesthetic'
- Golf / Tennis: Considered as upper-class sports, like 'SportyandRich' aiming to be
- Diana: Their muse, Princess Diana
